This is an intuitive judgement, on the basis that Ethereum without contracts would be less useful than Ethereum without user interfaces, and contract languages are more challenging to build due to the novel environment (EVM) and harsh security conditions (eg. can't update). Vyper is a high-level language for backend, and web3.js feels analogous to a high-level language for the frontend.

Across Ethereum's history, Vyper seems to be ~4% of Ethereum smart contract usage. https://blockworks.co/news/vyper-ethereum-smart-contract-language

Meanwhile web3.js is a dominant library used in all kinds of frontend applications, though there are now alternatives, particularly ethers.js. Various checks suggest about a 2:1 ratio in usage today, though this is only recent, so I'll assign web3.js a 80% ""market share"".

This implies a 1:20 ratio in market shares, but a 2:1 ratio in value provided, so a total ratio of 1:10 in web3.js's favor."

If we compare their contributions to client diversity, as measured by how much they reduce the HH index, we get:

Consensus status quo: 0.288
Consensus without Lighthouse: 0.402
Execution status quo: 0.341
Execution without reth: 0.355

Contribution ratio: 0.114 / 0.014 = 8.1x

Averaging the two, lighthouse is 12x more impactful.

However, I would argue that execution clients are more challenging to write, the spec is more complex, and it would be harder for ethereum to recover from not having execution clients than not having consensus clients. Hence I give execution clients a 2x multiplier.

So, total 6x to lighthouse."

Arbitrum: 44m

3.5B on L2 (average of GPT estimate and Perplexity estimate)

ERC4337: 1.6m (same link as above)

Hence, today ERC4337 is about 0.1% of all usage. Account abstraction is very promising in general, but as of today its live usage is roughly at that level.

The features that account abstraction covers (security, gas payments, multi-userops...) are crucial to Ethereum, I would intuitively say 2x more than execution clients. Prysm is 33% of execution client market share, or 28% if we measure by their shares of contribution to client diversity [ie. their marginal impact on the HH index], we'll average to 0.305.

Hence, we compare 0.305 vs 0.001 * 2, and we get a factor of 153x more value provided to-date from Prysm."

Foundry uses Solidity which has a much broader user base.  Looking at github star and fork metrics lines up with the assessment that Foundry is more important, with fork count suggesting foundry being 2.19x more valuable than vyper and star count suggesting foundry bing 1.73x more valuable than vyper.  Using ""github topics"" (https://github.com/topics/), foundry has 998 repositories vs vyper's 199 repositories, suggesting foundry is 5.01x more valuable.  Looking at the solidity ecosystem, which has 19,411 repositories on github, this further re-inforces foundry being more important.  Diversity of tools is valuable in our ecosystem, however, my personal opinion is that Vyper does not represent healthy diversity as I'm not confident that it would be a responsiible language for a company to build on.

I found it difficult to find any objective measure of how much helios is used for any production use cases. My intuition is that it is probably used very little, as the use of it represents an inherent *risk* or overhead, given that each call it makes requires the front-end to do extra work to verify the data, which for a front-end application means added latency and poor-er UX.

Erigon is just one of the execution clients and holds about a 3% market share. In contrast, Alloy is a Rust library for interacting with Ethereum. Since they’re quite different, let’s compare them from a few angles.

First, consider GitHub stars. As of February 2025, Erigon has 3.3k stars while Alloy has 0.8k stars, meaning Erigon’s count is roughly 4.13 times higher. However, it’s important to remember that GitHub stars accumulate over time, and Erigon is an older project.

Next, on a more subjective level: Erigon, despite its low market share, plays an important role in ensuring diversity among clients. On the other hand, Alloy—being a complete rewrite of ethers‑rs—is becoming the de facto standard for Ethereum interaction libraries in Rust.

I personally believe Rust will be an increasingly important language in the blockchain world due to its excellent performance and growing adoption across many areas. As the importance of Rust engineers rises, so too will the significance of Alloy.

While Erigon may have more GitHub stars, when considering these broader factors, I think Alloy offers four times the value to Ethereum’s success compared to Erigon."

Helios is a light client implementation written in Rust, while Sourcify is a tool for verifying smart contract code. Since these two serve different purposes, they can’t be directly compared, so I’ll compare them from a few perspectives.

First, consider GitHub stars. As of February 2025, Helios has 1.9k stars compared to Sourcify’s 0.8k, making Helios 2.4 times more popular. Additionally, the GitHub API shows that Sourcify was created in April 2019, whereas Helios was launched in August 2022. This means that despite being newer, Helios has managed to gather more stars.

Next, from a more subjective viewpoint: Helios, developed by a16z, supports both Ethereum and OP Stack chains. Increasing the number of users running light clients is crucial for Ethereum’s future because it reduces the need to trust RPC providers and helps promote decentralization. On the other hand, Sourcify’s role in verifying smart contract code is useful in addressing the centralization seen in services like Etherscan, but its overall importance might not be as significant.

For these reasons, I believe that Helios is eight times more valuable than Sourcify."

Note that Erigon is also known to be significant inspiration for many design decisions in Reth.

Using Herfindahl indices (0.341 with Reth, 0.355 without it), one can argue that Reth makes the staking client distribution 3.85% more decentralized. If we take this marginal contribution as a fraction of all marginal contributions, we get (0.0385 / (0.0385 + ...)) = 0.0410, ie. Reth is doing 4% of the work of improving client decentralization. Averaging these two, we give it a 3% contribution share.

web.js is a crucial library for the user interface layer; AI estimates it to have a 20% market share.

Intuitively, it feels like execution clients are ~3x more important than the web3 library: Ethereum cannot survive without the former, though the latter is still very important.

Teku is a consensus client built in Java, while Foundry is a tool that helps with developing smart contracts. They aren’t directly comparable, so I’ll consider both objective and subjective factors.

First, objectively, let’s look at GitHub stars. As of February 2025, Teku has about 700 stars, while Foundry has around 8,600 stars—that’s roughly 12.3 times more. Moreover, according to the GitHub API, Teku was created in September 2018, but Foundry was launched in September 2021, which makes Foundry’s star count even more impressive given its shorter lifespan.

Subjectively, Teku is just one of several consensus clients and is the third most used. Foundry, on the other hand, is a highly useful tool for writing smart contracts in Solidity. Although Hardhat used to be the de facto standard, Foundry has essentially replaced it. It even allows you to write tests in Solidity and, being built in Rust, it’s very fast. I believe Foundry will play a major role in the future of the Ethereum ecosystem—much more so than Teku.

Solidity is one of the smart contract languages built in C++, while Fe is also a smart contract language but is built in Rust. I’ll explain my reasoning with both objective and subjective points.

Objective Comparison:
Looking at GitHub stars as of February 2025, Solidity has 23.9k stars compared to Fe’s 8.6k. In addition, when checking repository creation dates via the GitHub API, Teku (associated with Solidity) was created in September 2018, whereas Foundry (associated with Fe) was created in September 2021. This shows that Foundry is newer yet has managed to gather a significant number of stars.

Subjective Assessment:
Solidity is, without a doubt, the de facto standard for implementing EVM contracts. There is a robust ecosystem built around Solidity, and with trends like zkVM emerging, the specific language used may eventually become less critical. Although Fe might have some superior features compared to Solidity, I personally don’t see it having as much impact on Ethereum’s future success.

For these reasons, I conclude that Solidity is 13 times more valuable to Ethereum’s success than Fe."

So not only is this like comparing Nethermind to a less frequently used client like Reth, it's also comparing execution clients to a programming language that uses the chain which is probably 2 to 1 importance. I'd give Solidity a higher score but just about the only thing I've encountered in Vyper is Curve and they had a hack specifically because of the Vyper compiler a few years ago."
